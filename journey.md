**Let's Just Redefine The Real Meaning of Life in Never Ending Journey!**

## Chapter 1: From the darkness!

**I really don't know What exactly I like? And What I want to be?**

So, Let's Start with **Foundational fundamentals.** (It's
inspired, thank you to all of them!)

### **1st Programming language as tool!** (Main Motive to learn Concepts)

Here is the deal, I have a weird experience in programming.
I try C/C++, Java, Python, JavaScript and Go (only basic syntax). I not actually solve any problems, or I can say not actually understand about programming.

The actual 1st Programming language: I think it should be Statically Typed and Compiled Language. And I like Go language the most.

**"Yes! Go is Good for Goblins"**
